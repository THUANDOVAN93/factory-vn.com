<h2 class="header_hgroup mb30 title-row">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>When acquiring personal information, the Company shall clarify the purpose of use, obtain it in a fair manner, and never use it beyond the scope of the purpose of use.<br />
In addition, we will take measures that are necessary to prevent use out of the purpose.</p>

<h3 class="sttl_hgroup"><span>Definition of personal information</span></h3>
<p>Personal information is information about the user personally, which means that the user can be identified by that information such as the name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, school name and other descriptions that constitute the information.<br />
In addition, even if it can not be identified using that information alone, it can be easily compared with other information, and as a result, personal information can also be defined as personal information.</p>

<h3 class="sttl_hgroup"><span>Purpose of use of personal information</span></h3>
<p>The purpose of using personal information is as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>1. We use the personal information of our business partners in order to contact regarding transactions.</li>
<li>2. We use the personal information of the inquired person for identification and response at the time of inquiry.</li>
<li>3. We use the personal information in order to provide members with personal identification and services for members.</li>
<li>4. We use the personal information for the purpose which is confirmed by the person in advance.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="sttl_hgroup"><span>Third-party provision of personal information</span></h3>
<p>The Company will not provide personal information to third parties without obtaining the consent of the person, except in cases where it is required by law. However, real estate property information collected from a real estate company for the purpose of disclosure is not limited to this.</p>

<h3 class="sttl_hgroup"><span>Consignment of personal information handling</span></h3>
<p>In business operations, we may outsource some of our operations in order to provide customers with better services. At that time, we may deposit personal information with the business consignee. In this case, we will select a subcontractor that meets the sufficient level of protection of personal information, conclude a consignment contract for the protection of personal information, and thoroughly control and supervise the subcontractor.</p>
